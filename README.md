# OpenCV-Sudoku-Solver-GUI
Today challange, the most diffucult sudoku games. Sudoku games has a lot of digits so we should use image processing. We need to classify this digits so we must to use deep learning models. We use to opencv, keras and tensorflow libraries.

We using original frame, top picture. Next Level.

You view thresh image on the top. Next challanges contours, find digit contours and predict digits.

YES. Predicted digits with deep learning model. Go to result.

You viewing result on the top. Result time is less than one second. 

Thank you.
